        <article class="element-block__content">
    <p>Within the traditional industry of software development there tend to be three (although related) forms of Agile in use although each organisation and within each team will use the elements that fit their needs. These are known as Scrum, XP (eXtreme Programming) and Kanban. I'm not going to go into these in great detail, consult the resource links below for more information on these. The key message is that Agile methodologies actively encourage change and adopting 'what works for you'. Each methodology prescribes certain ways of working and all require discipline if they are to work. Kanban is the least prescriptive of the three with XP being the most prescriptive (XP is effectively a superset of rules on top of Scrum).</p>
<p>When deciding on how to apply Agile to your business you have to first understand the challenges that you face and how that is degrading your ability to perform and to make the most out of your people. It is also important to remember that Agile is not a 'silver bullet' but a good Agile implementation will reveal where external problems lie and allow you to begin to look at ways of dealing with them.</p>
<h3>Take the Agile MOT...</h3>
<p>If you or your team can answer yes to any of these questions then you may benefit from looking at an Agile solution...</p>
<ul>
<li>Are stress and tension levels in your team very high?</li>
<li>Do you find that you have to work extremely long hours?</li>
<li>Do you frequently feel like you are trying to do 'a million and one things at once'?</li>
<li>Do you have an 'us' and 'them' view between groups in your organisation?</li>
<li>Do you spend more than 10% of your time following 'process'?</li>
<li>Are you missing, or narrowly making, client deadlines?</li>
<li>Do you frequently ask yourself 'why am I doing this'?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take the Agile Test Drive...</h3>
<p>When starting down the Agile road the key thing to keep in mind when designing your initial Agile implementation is that less is more. Every organisation has different needs. Unless your team is doing software development then full XP is probably far more than they will need and many of it's elements will not be relevant. Any Agile methodology has the following key 'rules'...</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrospectives to review the process itself - Although often overlooked these are essential to success. Agile processes should be able to grow and evolve to meet the needs of the team. These can be simple and short or involved as the needs of the business dictate.</li>
<li>Limit work - This may sound counter-intuitive but many of today's problems with dysfunctional teams are due to overloading of work. As a result of overloading productivity drops, mistakes get made, deadlines missed and clients lost. It is essential to understand the capability of a team to deliver at any time.</li>
<li>Transparency - Agile methodologies require known workloads to be visible to the entire team throughout the workflow or project life cycle. This is key as the team are always aware of the workload present on any one skill-set or member of the team and they can then plan their work accordingly.</li>
<li>Self organisation - In an Agile environment teams should be responsible for organising themselves and their process. Work should be picked up by the team rather than given to them by Management. Management's job is to help facilitate this process and remove any impediments that may arise. This is often one of the hardest changes for a traditional business but it brings the biggest rewards; the team rapidly begins to develop a communal feeling of responsibility for the work that gets done and a desire to help out their colleagues wherever possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>With non-technical organisations a simple Kanban implementation is often a good starting point (see the link below on 'Kanban &amp; SCRUM - Making the best of both' for some good information on Kanban implementations). Using Kanban you can start with some simple estimates as to acceptable workload at different parts of the teams workflow, put together a board on a wall with this initial set up and then adjust through time where things aren't working quite as expected. The key thing to remember is to keep things as simple as possible. Its always easier to add something later.</p>
