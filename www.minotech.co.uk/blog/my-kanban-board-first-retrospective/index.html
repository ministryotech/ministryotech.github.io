<article class="element-block__content">
    <p>I finally got round to my first retrospective today. I wanted to wait at least a couple of weeks so I could build up some meaningful figures before I started to pull everything apart. I found that I very quickly adapted my usage of the board to putting tasks in WIP the day before that I wanted to follow up the day after. Although this served a useful purpose in my mind it soon caused problems of it's own.</p>
<p>I initially began by allocating Fibonacci sequence estimates to each task be it Development, Business or Personal. My initial estimates were quite flaky but they started to get more solid after four or five days. What I found though was that I had points left over each day in the WIP column. I didn't want to take any points for these tasks half way through as they weren't done but I was also acutely aware that they would start skewing my figures for following days as I completed tasks so I started noting them down too. The figures below show each day in turn. The first figure shows the points done and the second figure the points remaining in WIP at the end of the day (N/A marks days off).</p>

<p>Ignoring days where I've gained lots of points by completing many tasks that had been carried over I can get a rough average of around 10 points a day, erring on the pessimistic side. This then gives me something to work with. I now have the following information which I can use to re-evaluate how the board is working from the figures above and my notes of the last few weeks...</p>
<ul>
<li>I can do an average of 10 points a day</li>
<li>Lots of hanging over points on the board gets messy</li>
<li>I need somewhere to put tasks for tomorrow that isn't WIP</li>
<li>Too many points of work on the board at any one time gets messy</li>
<li>Points for Dev tasks at different stages get lost</li>
</ul>
<p>My next step is to decide what I can do to mitigate these problems. I have decided to do the following...</p>
<ol>
<li>ToDo Box - Having a ToDo box is fairly common in Kanban scenarios but, when first setting up my board, I felt that it was probably overkill for 1 guy sat in a home office managing himself and I went with the 'start with less and see how it goes' strategy. With the hindsight that the retrospective gives me I can see now that, for my needs, it's pretty essential. I also found, during the last few weeks, that I had a tendency to overload myself and 'fill up' the board so, to avoid that, I've set a few rules on the ToDo box.
<ul>
<li>The ToDo box can only hold a maximum of 10 points of work at any time (Arbitrary for now - to review)</li>
<li>The ToDo box should only hold crucial work - I can always add other stuff later. Just because I can take 10 points doesn't mean that I have to.</li>
<li>Items in the ToDo box count as being 'on the board' (this will make sense as you read on)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limit The Board - I found that, despite other restrictions, it was easy to overload the board with tasks. Whereas individual columns are limited by a number of concurrent tasks I have decided to limit the total number of points on the board at any one time. This is initially an arbitrary figure of 21. I'll keep reviewing this in subsequent retrospectives and see how it goes. As noted above, items put into the ToDo box also count as 'on the board'. This will also encourage smaller task breakdown.</li>
<li>Separate Estimates for Dev Tasks - The workflow and lead time elements of Kanban are not so relevant for me as I am working alone and I am also each stage in the process. Where this fell over for me over the last few weeks was with Dev tasks. Unlike my other categories, Dev tasks have three stages; Dev, Test/Review and Deploy. Being used to SCRUM I wasn't giving myself any points until the dev tasks were done (and since I haven't deployed anything yet I got a bog fat zero). This doesn't really fit with the daily progress model that suits other work so well. To address this I am going to estimate dev work with three estimates; one for each category. The idea here is that I take the points each time the task moves along the board and the points value for the task that represents the area of the board it's on is it's value when working out the total value of the board (So a task with a 5 estimate for dev and a 7 estimate for Test/Review counts as either 5 or 7, depending on where it's sat; not as 12). I'm going to see how this goes and review it again in a couple of weeks.</li>
