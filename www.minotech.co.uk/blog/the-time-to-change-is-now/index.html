<article class="element-block__content">
    <p>Recent events have made it clear that the time remaining to save our planet is limited. Somewhat horrifically, a recent Sky Poll discovered that less than half of the UK population are willing to make any of the significant changes to their lifestyles that are needed in order to make a small movement towards carbon neutrality.</p>
<p>Individuals become trapped within the social models and ways of seeing the world that they are used to - it's simple human nature and fundamental to how we learn. If we want to make significant changes to people's lifestyles we must first enable these changes by removing the norms that their rejection to change is based upon. This is where we fail to make significant change on a regular basis. Repeated attempts at reducing car usage in Bristol have failed time and again because the provision of public transport services just isn't there to offer an alternative that will enable people to get out of their cars. We cannot afford to fail now.</p>
<p>We still live in a world that is focused on the need to commute - that to be successful you need to travel a long way to work. We have, over the last 30 years or so, built a society that continues to focus ever more on centralisation of services, workplaces and entertainment, forcing people to travel. Before we can get people to be happy with the idea of getting rid of their cars we first need to reverse this trend and, while Minotech can't do much about bringing back your local Cinema, <a data-udi="umb://document/6e02935fb81c4f28aeaf10253d0cb6b8" href="../../services/remote-control/index.html" title="Remote Control">we can help your business take the steps it needs to take to remove it's traffic from the roads by becoming primarily remote</a>.</p>
<h1>What can my business do?</h1>
<p>The Ministry of Technology (and the associated Ministry Network) operates with the following objectives...</p>
<ul>
<li>All work, where possible to do so, will be carried out remotely.</li>
<li>Where collective meetings are necessary between The Ministry of Technology and network team members they shall take place in a temporary hired space.</li>
<li>Collective communications will take place using internet communications technology.</li>
<li>All infrastructure shall be cloud managed and not location or device dependent.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is, obviously, a guideline. A couple of client meetings each sprint at the client office is fine. There's no reason why we can't do our development work from our own home offices. For our clients it means they don't need to provide space for us. It means we can be more competitive as we can quote without having to take travel costs into account. We are still right at the other end of a video chat for any ad-hoc requests.</p>
<p>We started this process nearly a year ago now, after I developed problems that made commute driving very difficult for me and I haven't looked back. In fact, it's gone so well for use that I'm now offering services to other businesses to help them get up to speed with remote working too.</p>
<h1>Why should I go fully or partially remote?</h1>
<p>Remote working is the future. Why is it the future? Not because it's new or cool, but because it's <strong>necessary</strong>. This is why...</p>
<ul>
<li>The climate change report requires us to significantly reduce the amount of travel that we are doing across the board - daily drives into and out of cities will have to stop.</li>
<li>As Extinction Rebellion has shown, the health of our planet is crucial. While the government eyes a carbon neutral 2050, in reality this is woefully inadequate and I fully expect protesting to speed up this process to continue to build until we have started to turn a corner.</li>
<li>The UK's transport infrastructure is on it's knees - road and rail transport are over capacity in some areas in excess of 500%.</li>
<li>Pubic transport is not available where and when needed for many commuters.</li>
<li>The cost of Brexit will make the UK a significantly poorer country, lack of money to invest will exacerbate the decline of infrastructure.</li>
<li>The cost of inner city living is way out of reach of most now. As the infrastructure worsens house prices in cities will rise and outside will fall (in relative terms).</li>
<li>The popularity of flexible working spaces like Bristol's Desklodge and Engine Shed are growing at an exponential rate already as businesses that are ahead of the curve start to look at scaling down their office footprint already.</li>
<li>As the above issues grow and commuting becomes a longer process the available skill pool reduces, making recruitment of permanent staff or on-site partners much harder.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what our future looks like. We can see the effects now and they have been escalating rapidly, Within 5 years I would expect that many more businesses will be looking seriously at their physical office footprint and looking at how and where they can move their working remote. <a data-udi="umb://document/6e02935fb81c4f28aeaf10253d0cb6b8" href="../../services/remote-control/index.html" title="Remote Control">Let us help you be at the forefront of this change</a>.</p>
