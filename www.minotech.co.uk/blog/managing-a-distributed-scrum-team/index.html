        <article class="element-block__content">
    <p>I have recently started managing a Scrum team that consists of developers both working directly for me, in the same physical location, and developers that work for another company that we subcontract work out to. When I mentioned this to an old friend of mine from a previous workplace he seemed interested to know how it had worked out, so I thought I'd post up some of my experiences. I view the role of the Scrum master as being someone to provide a service to the developers to ensure that they can be their most productive at all times. I also share the Technical Architect role for the project which potentially adds an additional layer of complexity (man of many hats!).</p>
<p>When the project started with Scrum, soon after I had come on board, all of the key development resource was sited with the third party company. With the first of my roles clearly in my head I looked initially to break the direct association between specific work assignment to enable focus on the sprint itself. This is one of the most challenging elements when dealing with team members that are brought in from a third party organisation; even more so as they have been contracted for delivery of a specific subset of the project. Clear communication here about the values of ensuring that best practices are followed and that additional resources are available (from the internal development team) if necessary to ensure that key requirements are met according to deadlines made this transition fairly smooth. Initially this internal resource support was largely me, so the workload in the first sprint was quite extreme from my end to ensure that they continued to work smoothly, but the end result was fantastic.</p>
<p>The initial estimation session was a very long session and, at the end of it, I felt strongly that the remote team members had heavily overcommitted (a common issue for a first sprint) but, at the end of the sprint all bar one of the stories on the backlog were done, we had an agreed sign off process in place with the product owner (which previously hadn't happened until later in the lifecycle) and the general feeling between the remote team, myself and the product owner was really positive. At the end of the sprint we held our first retrospective and the remote developers were really liking the way that communication was going. They also raised some issues which we were then able to, largely, action and get improved for the following sprint.</p>
<p>The second sprint is still ongoing, so I'll report back on that later. I found myself more stretched by far on the second sprint. Although the third party guys were now far more comfortable with things and I had less direct issues to deal with, the second sprint was also when three members of my local team started. This added the responsibility of training up three new starters at the same time as trying to support the remote team. At some points there wasn't really enough of me to go around but the new starters have managed to pick things up pretty quickly and are already now starting to run with stories off their own initiative to a certain extent. We initially had some 'getting to know you' meetings and a lunch gathering so that the two teams would feel like they were working together as part of a unified whole rather than feel isolated from each other. I think keeping this balance effectively will be a challenge for me over the next few sprints.</p>
<p>Stand-Ups have been an interesting one. We initially started off having shared stand-ups using Skype, but this wasn't necessarily proving relevant as, currently, the teams are not working on directly related work. We've now moved to separate stand-ups (one locally and one over the phone) for expediency, but this will have to be looked at again if the work taken on by each team becomes more inter-meshed.</p>
<p>These are interesting times. Challenging, Hard and Fun!</p>
