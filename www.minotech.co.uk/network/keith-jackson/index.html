<h2>Consultancy History</h2>
<h3>Parity Projects Development Mentor</h3>
<p><strong>(April 2019 - )</strong><br /><strong>Technical Mentor</strong></p>
<p>Providing training and guidance on implementation of best practices including Unit Testing, TDD, architectural patterns, source control techniques and DevOps in expectation of a DevOps project kick off towards the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Esoterix CTO</h3>
<p><strong>(Sep 2016 – Mar 2018)</strong><br /><strong>CTO</strong></p>
<p>I joined Esoterix, a transport orientated solutions developer, at the time they needed to begin designing and developing technical solutions for Innovate UK and European funded projects to experiment with different types of first / last mile taxi / bus integration services to enhance the public transport network to a point where public transport was the obvious choice for travel rather than usage of a car.</p>
<p>My role at Esoterix was extremely wide ranging as a start up CTO – From initially designing and coding MVPs myself while gradually building a development team from nothing up to 4, scaling up other parts of the business as it became necessary to redesigning the platform architecture for post MVP growth. Over the period my role encompassed Lead Developer, Technical Architect, Scrum Master, Tester, Mentor, DevOps, Infrastructure Support, Line management and Product Owner roles as well as informing technical direction as part of the C-Level board. I worked with external partners on projects both academic and practical.</p>
<h3>The Pragmatic Agile Community</h3>
<p><strong>(May 2016 – Present)</strong><br /><strong>Founder</strong></p>
<p>I began gathering a community of like-minded pragmatic agilists together in order to discuss, debate and find a productive way forward for the agile community in the face of growing agile dogma. The core web platform is now available and a certification scheme has been established for experts in the field to peer review each other and certify highly capable individuals as being experienced with agile from a pragmatic perspective, utilising multiple frameworks and techniques. The advent of GDPR made this venture unprofitable and the website is now purely informational.</p>
<h3>Somo Delivery Transformation</h3>
<p><strong>(October 2015 - April 2016)</strong><br /><strong>Agile Coach &amp; Consultant, Pilot Scrum Master</strong></p>
<p><span>I provided Agile consultancy services to co-design the transformation of Somo's delivery structure </span>from a basic waterfall / studio combined structure<span> into a Scrum based delivery system for 3 teams and 1 team running Kanban. As a Digital agency, Somo has many clients and teams have to be able to deliver to multiple client products at once while maximising the potential of skill sharing. This started with a pilot phase where I acted as a Scrum master for a pilot team working with the US office to evolve the implementation strategy for the rest of the engineering teams in the business.</span></p>
<p><span>I recruited new Scrum master roles into the business and both wrote and provided detailed custom training courses on Scrum &amp; Agile basics, tailored to Product Owners, Team Members &amp; Project Managers while mentoring existing staffs through the new ways of working. I reconfigured the existing JIRA system to a more flexible form to suit the new approaches and provided training on the changes.</span></p>
<h3>Somo Rolefinder Project</h3>
<p><strong>(Jul 2014 - October 2015)</strong><br /><strong>Lead Developer, DevOps, Facilitator</strong></p>
<p>I Facilitated the project, initially with 3 developers and 3 QA dedicated to the project for the first 4 months then took responsibility for the full life-cycle, development and most of the testing in the support period that followed liaising with the client’s project manager, providing the interface to the end client. I introduced the team to several key agile concepts to improve the flow of work and facilitated estimation of tasks to report the current state of the project back to the project manager.</p>
<p>The team went through several distinct iterative phases of workflow, each time moving away from the initial waterfall spec to add elements to the workflow pipeline to improve quality and reduce bugs.</p>
<h3><span>Kindeo</span></h3>

I built up the development infrastructure and team for this work from scratch and acted in a half management / half technical capacity. I acted as a Scrum Master across two teams, one internal and one 3<sup>rd</sup> party working remotely and presided over methodology transition from Scrum to Kanban agile approaches. I was technically responsible for coaching and pairing with my team members, providing high-level technical concepts and developing smaller scale applications within the scope of the project. Here I began to develop paradigms for agile delivery in a digital agency environment.</p>

<p>Development of a logging microservice to support taking event logging information from apps and websites within the product suite and storing them either in SQL Azure or Cosmos DB Graph storage, depending on configuration and usage.</p>
<h3>Buzz 2.0 POCs</h3>
<p><strong>ESOTERIX<br />(Dec 2017 - Mar 2018)<br /></strong>C#7, dotnet core 2.0, ASP.Net Core 2.0, JavaScript, React, JSX, CosmosDB (Graph &amp; Document), SQL Azure, Identity Server<br /><strong>Technical Architect, CTO<br /></strong></p>
<p>Architectural design for the next generation of the Buzz platform, transforming the MVP into a microservice architecture using a mixture of isolated data sources including Graph and Document databases, as appropriate to need. The system POCs were built using dotnet core 2.0 and CosmosDB in Graph mode with libraries created for graph structured dynamic logging and to translate defined object structures from a common model to the appropriate type of data store. The new front end is to be a React based front end as an SPA, designed to incorporate the appropriate services for the type of transport experiment that the application needs to support. The application will run and scale on the Azure platform. Development work on this beyond the POC stage is ongoing.</p>
<h3>JourneyBatcher for Schools</h3>

<p>Product design and development of a themed Single Page Application (SPA) using React, wrapped in a secured harness using common internal Identity Server code for authentication. The application uses the Google Directions API and a backend processing mechanism, using ASP.Net Core WebAPI to batch process optimum journey options for planning school transport needs for councils. Data storage had to be temporary, so Cosmos DB in Document mode was an ideal solution, data set to expire and self-delete after a period of inactivity. DevOps and planning were managed by VSTS. Swagger was implemented, along with a custom API automation suite for end to end testing of the API.</p>
