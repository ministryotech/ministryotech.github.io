            <p>The concept of remote working is far from a new one. I first remember the early rumblings of it just after the turn of the millennium when internet access had started to become fairly ubiquitous and, while still slow, technologies were starting to evolve to speed up the internet access that the average person could benefit from.</p>
<p>Fast forward 15 or so years and things have changed, but not to anywhere near the extent that was expected. A swift review of the numerous remote working job websites quickly reveals a very US centric trend which, certainly the UK, lags far behind in.</p>
