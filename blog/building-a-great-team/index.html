<div class="main-strip">
    <section class="element-block element-block--main">
        <article class="element-block__content">
    <p>I read an article yesterday on building 10x teams on <a rel="noopener" href="http://avichal.wordpress.com/2011/12/16/focus-on-building-10x-teams-not-on-hiring-10x-developers/" target="_blank" title="Archival's Blog">Archival's blog</a>. Not only did I agree wholeheartedly with the article, I found myself analysing my own team building processes with it in mind to look at the hires that I took on when putting together my last team.</p>
<p>To give you some background, I joined my last team as Scrum master / Technical Architect and Development Manager alongside an existing Project Manager about a year ago. We needed to put together a highly proficient team fairly rapidly to bring system development in-house. I had a pretty good idea of the 'mix' that I wanted in my head. Coming at the recruitment process with a clean slate is extremely refreshing, as you can pick the best team much easier than if you're trying to extend a team or fill a hole.</p>
<h3>What was I looking for?</h3>
<p>The first key thing I was looking for was a counterpoint to myself. Since I would be covering three roles within the team, I wanted a team member with the strength of character to question me when required, keeping me honest and helping me through any conflicts of interest that may occur because of my multiple hats.</p>
<p>The second thing I was looking for was someone with either existing testing exposure or someone who was passionate about quality and would be able to pick up these skills from me.</p>
<p>More than anything I wanted a group of people with different personal and technical skills and an open nature that would encourage rapid cross-polination of the skills across the team.</p>
<h3>What did I end up with?</h3>
<p>Looking at the article, it was clear that our Project Manager, recently moved to the role of Product Owner, was clearly a 'Little Engine That Could' and that I was part 'Lead Engineer', part 'Hustler' and primarily 'Teacher' depending on what hat I had to wear at any given time.</p>
<p>We hired four developers on the first round after interviewing about ten. They broke down as follows...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech Lead</strong> - My choice for technical lead was, unsurprisingly, clearly an 'Anti-Pinochio' type; exactly what I was looking for to balance me which, looking at the premise of the article, makes sense given the roles I was covering to some degree or another.</li>
<li><strong>Dev 1</strong> - My first choice for developer came across extremely well and I felt he had immense potential to exceed what he was currently doing (and didn't dissapoint). The guy was a natural sponge for new technologies and was equally challenging over approach; this guy became the 'Hustler' for the team.</li>
<li><strong>Dev 2</strong> - My second developer choice was an outside gamble which, initially, really paid off. This guy was relatively inexperienced compared to some of the other members of the team but extremely willing to learn. He was the teams 'Energizer Bunny'.</li>
<li><strong>Dev 3</strong> - My final dev hire I nearly didn't make (and he knows this). The second time I nearly didn't hire someone and both times they have turned out to be some of the best people I have worked with in my career. Both were the 'Hearts' of the team without a shadow of a doubt. Finding a good heart for your team is absolutely essential. The qualities of finding a good 'Heart' team member are very difficult to quantify and if you aren't careful you can let them slip through your fingers; there's more of a gut feeling to this than most of the other types.</li>
