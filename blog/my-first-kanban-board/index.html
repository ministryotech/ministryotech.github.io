<article class="element-block__content">
    <p>With most of my prior Agile experience being in using and applying Scrum and also finding that Scrum was a bit overkill for me to use as a single individual I decided to spend an hour this morning coming up with my own Agile board to fit all the different things I'm dealing with day to day. What I quickly realised was that a common flow wasn't going to fit. With this in mind I split the board into three rows; Development, Business and Other. Above is a picture of my board. I apologise for lack of clarity but it's rather gloomy today and getting a decent picture proved tricky.</p>
<p>The first column on the far left is my long To Do list. I just add stuff to this as I think of it or as new work comes along. This isn't split by area and as I'm feeding the work to myself I don't bother to keep it in priority order. What you can't see on the picture is an area to the bottom with a heading of 'Blocked' - These are to do tasks which I can't start because I have a dependency or I'm waiting for something outside of the workflow to begin them. This just helps keep me focused on what I can deliver without continually revisiting stuff. This fits my current situation but will probably change.</p>
<p>The second column is a row heading (Dev, Business or Other); You can just make out that the 'Dev' heading has a 2 scrawled on it. I wanted to add an extra restriction to myself so that in addition to restricting the work I have going on at different points of the flow I also wanted to restrict the maximum pieces of work going through the development cycle at any one time. This was to ensure that I don't overcommit to potential work and refers to projects rather than Post-Its. I'm going to list the projects and swap them out as needed under this heading but I want some more colourful Post-Its first (see column 3!)</p>
<p>The third column is my WIP column and is the only column that is used by all three rows. I wanted to have greater visibility of where items were in the development workflow but business stuff and 'other' (internal support / housework etc.) items are either WIP or done and I didn't want to overcomplicate them. I have scrawled the numbers 1 / 2 / 2 on WIP, the numbers referring to each row. This restricts me to working on 1 dev task, 2 business tasks and 2 'other' tasks at any one time. You can't make them out too easily, but the current Dev task is to port the old SilkenWeb.Extensions library into the MOT Framework Extensions project whereas the business tasks are to write this article and to return some documentation I got from a potential future client this morning. The other tasks are fairly mundane (one is to buy more Post-It notes). As I said in my earlier Agile article this is a learning process. I may expand the Dev WIP to allow more than one task at a time when I start to get more clients but I'll see where things sit in a couple of weeks and do a retrospective.</p>
<p>Columns four through six are only relevant for Dev. I've tried to keep this quite generic but again, time will tell whether these columns perform the roles I expect. I have a specific column for Test / Review; to perform manual testing (if relevant) and / or get a client to review a piece of work. This is a really vague column and I'm not convinced it feels right in the workflow yet but I've decided to go with it and see how it works out longer term. In the meantime it fits as I'm porting libraries that have existing unit tests so this part of the workflow covers porting and running the tests. I forsee this as being more client focused long term and possibly being optional. There then follows a column for documentation. Again optional, this will involve either writing blog articles or client documentation for the dev work done. The final column of the Dev specific three is for deployment. I initially added this with the Framework tasks in mind as I wanted to constrain the amount of items awaiting deploy. These would then stack up and trigger me to produce a release package to clear the blockage in the flow. I initially set this to 1 but, in hindsight, I've set it to 3 as source code is available anyway and I don't want to over invest time in package deployment where I get a minimal return.</p>
<p>I'll keep posting as my board evolves.</p>
