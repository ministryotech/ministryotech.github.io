<h2>5. PRICE</h2>
<p>5.1. The prices of the Services are quoted on request or on the Website. <br />5.2. Prices quoted are for performance of the Services in the United Kingdom unless otherwise specified.<br />5.3. Unless otherwise stated, the prices quoted exclude VAT. <br />5.4. We reserve the right, by giving notice to you at any time before delivery or performance of our obligations to you, to increase the price of the Services to reflect any increase in the cost to us due to any factor beyond our control (such as without limitation, any foreign exchange fluctuation, significant increase in the costs of labour, materials or other costs of manufacture). In the unlikely event of this occurring, you shall be entitled to cancel the order at any time before we have commenced providing the Services.</p>
<h2>6. PAYMENT</h2>
<p>6.1. Payment can be made by direct bank transfer or by cheque. We reserve the right to levy additional charges for payments made by cheque.<br />6.2. Payments are due 30 days from the date of invoice dispatch.<br />6.3. Additional expenses to be charged will be agreed with you before invoicing by email or writing. Large-scale expenses may require some payment upfront before work can be commenced. <br />6.4. By accepting these Conditions you undertake that all the details you provide to us for the purpose of purchasing the Services are correct and that the payment card you are using is your own and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the Services ordered<br />6.5. We shall contact you should any problems occur with your payment.<br />6.6. We will take all reasonable care, in so far as it is in our power to do so, to keep the details of your order and payment secure, but in the absence of negligence on our part, we cannot be held liable for any loss you may suffer if a third party procures unauthorised access to any data you provide when communicating with us.</p>
<h2>7. ORDER PROCESS AND FORMATION OF A CONTRACT</h2>
<p>7.1. All orders are subject to acceptance and availability. If any Services ordered are not available, you will be notified by email and you will have the option either to wait until the item is available or to cancel your order. It is your responsibility to provide us with a valid email address so that we can contact you if necessary. <br />7.2. Any order placed by you constitutes an offer to purchase the Services from us. All such offers received from you are subject to acceptance by us and we reserve the right to refuse any order placed by you at any time prior to acceptance, without providing an explanation. <br />7.3. You shall be responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the details provided by you during the order process and we will not accept an order unless all details requested from you have been entered correctly.<br />7.4. You agree that if we contact you to acknowledge receipt of your order such communication shall not amount to our acceptance of your offer to purchase the Services ordered by you from the Website.<br />7.5. A contract between you and us (the 'Contract') incorporating these Conditions will only subsist after we have debited your payment card and have confirmed that we shall be providing the requested Service or made it available to be downloaded. We will send you an email to confirm this (a 'Confirmation Notice'). The Confirmation Notice will amount to an acceptance of your offer to buy the Services from us. The Contract will only be formed when we send you the Confirmation Notice (whether or not you receive it).<br />7.6. Where we agree to supply Services to you permanently or on an ongoing (continuous) basis, such as by subscription, they shall be provided for a minimum fixed period of time (the 'Minimum Duration'). The length of the Minimum Duration will depend on which package or product you have selected to purchase and is provided on the Website. <br />7.7. The Contract will relate only to the Services stated in the Confirmation Notice. We will not be obliged to supply any other Services which may have been part of your order until we have sent you a separate Confirmation Notice relating to it. <br />7.8. You must check that the details contained in the Confirmation Notice are correct and you should print out and keep a copy of it. <br />7.9. You will be subject to the version of our policies and Conditions in force at the time that you order the Services from us, unless:<br /><br />7.9.1. Any change to those policies or these Conditions is required to be made by law or governmental authority <br />7.9.2. We notify you of any change to our policies or these Conditions before we send you the Confirmation Notice, in which case, we are entitled to assume that you have accepted it, unless we receive written notification from you to the contrary within seven working days of receipt of the Confirmation Notice.</p>
<h2>8. DELIVERY</h2>
<p>8.1. Any dates quoted for completing performance of the Service are approximate only. If no date is specified then it will take place within 30 days or a reasonable time of the date of the Confirmation Notice, unless there are exceptional circumstances. <br />8.2. We shall not be liable for any delay in completing performance of the Service, however caused.<br />8.3. The Services may be sent to you in instalments.</p>
<h2>9. CANCELLING YOUR CONTRACT AND RETURNS</h2>

<p>9.2.1. You are entitled to cancel your Contract and within 7 working days from the date of the Confirmation Notice. This also applies, where appropriate and subject to clause 11.4., to items that are available to be downloaded. However, you will no longer have a right to cancel if, with your agreement, we have already commenced providing the Services to you before this period of time expires. We shall be deemed to have already commenced providing the Services, in circumstances where you have already downloaded products or materials that we made available to you, from the Website.<br />9.2.2. You may notify us of your wish to cancel by sending us a cancellation notice to keith@minotech.co.uk or a letter to Flat 7, Ladymead, 1 Castle Road, Clevedon, North Somerset, BS21 7BX. Your cancellation notice must quote your name, address, the name or a description of the services and your order reference number.<br />9.2.3. Upon receiving your cancellation notice, we will contact you providing any necessary instructions which you will be required to follow.<br />9.2.4. So long as you have complied with your obligations under this clause, we will refund the purchase price to you by debiting the payment card you used to purchase the Services.<br />9.3. Cancelling ongoing Services.</p>
<p>9.3.1. Some of the Services that we provide are available for either a fixed period or unspecified period of time (such as support contracts).

You are entitled to cancel your Contract for any Recurrent Fixed Term Services and Recurrent Non-Fixed Term Services that you have purchased and obtain a refund within 7 working days from the date of the Confirmation Notice. This also applies, where appropriate, and subject to clause 11.4., to items that are available to be downloaded.<br />9.3.3. You will no longer have a right to cancel any Ongoing Fixed Term Services if, with your agreement, we have already commenced providing this service to you within 7 working days from the date of the Confirmation Notice. We shall be deemed to have already commenced providing the Ongoing Fixed Term Services, in circumstances where you have already downloaded products or materials that we made available to you from the Website. <br />9.3.4. In these circumstances you cannot cancel the Contract for any Ongoing Fixed Term Services until the end of the Minimum Duration (even where the Minimum Duration is more than one year) and you will not be entitled to a refund. <br />9.3.5. Although you may notify us of your intention to cancel an Ongoing Fixed Term Services at any time, such notice will only take effect after the Minimum Duration has elapsed. You may notify us of your wish to cancel the Ongoing Fixed Term Services by sending us a cancellation notice to keith@minotech.co.uk or a letter to Flat 7, Ladymead, 1 Castle Road, Clevedon, North Somerset, BS21 7BX. Your cancellation notice must quote your name, address, the name or a description of the services and your order reference number.<br />9.3.6. We may, at our sole discretion, agree to temporarily suspend any Ongoing Fixed Term Services if you will be unable to use the service, such as, for example, if you are going on holiday. We will require at least 30 working days' advance notice for this to be implemented. The maximum period of suspension will be 12 weeks in any calendar year. You may use the same contact details for providing a cancellation notice to request the Ongoing Fixed Term Services to be suspended.<br />9.3.7. You will still have a right to cancel any Ongoing Non-Fixed Term Services if we have already commenced providing this service to you within 7 working days from the date of the Confirmation Notice, upon giving us 2 weeks' advance notice in writing. You may notify us of your wish to cancel by sending us a cancellation notice to keith@minotech.co.uk or a letter to Flat 7, Ladymead, 1 Castle Road, Clevedon, North Somerset, BS21 7BX. Your cancellation notice must quote your name, address, the name or a description of the services and your order reference number. <br />9.4. Exception to the right to cancel</p>
<p>You will not have a right to cancel an order for any goods or services purchased from us, in the following situations:<br />9.4.1. If you expressly agree to us beginning to provide any services before the end of the cancellation period. <br />9.4.2. The Contract is for goods and/or services the price of which is dependent on fluctuations in the financial market which cannot be controlled by us<br />9.4.3.

<p>9.5. Incorrectly priced or described services</p>

In the unlikely event that the price and/or description of an item listed on the Website has been incorrectly advertised, we will not be under any obligation to sell or provide those services to you.<br />9.5.2. If we discover the error before sending you a Confirmation Notice we will at our discretion, either reject your order and notify you of such rejection, or inform you as soon as possible and give you the option of cancelling your order or reconfirming it at the correct price and/or description. If we give you the option of cancelling your order or reconfirming it at the correct price and/or description but either cannot contact you or do not receive your response within 14 days of sending you notification (whether or not you receive it), we will reject your order. <br />9.5.3. If we discover the error after sending you a Confirmation Notice we may, at our discretion and without incurring any liability to you, cancel the Contract provided that the error is, in our reasonable opinion, obvious and unmistakable and could have reasonably been recognised by you. We will notify if we cancel the Contract.<br />9.5.4. If your order is cancelled or rejected and you have already paid for the Services, you will receive a full refund in accordance with clause 11.7.</p>
<p>9.6. Delivery by instalments</p>
<p>9.6.1. The Services may be sent to you in instalments. You may cancel the outstanding part of your order and receive a refund, if you have already paid, of the purchase price of the outstanding Services in accordance with clause 11.7.</p>
